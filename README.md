## Fireflies ([Lampyridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly)) ala Imagineering

I've been wanting to create some fireflies for our outdoor train set, and have always loved them in the Pirates of the Carribean ride. A quick Google search turned up this project [Fireflies Project](http://www.hiddenmickeys.org/Imagineering/Fireflies.html)

The cool thing about this design is the simple mechanical method used to create the twinkling effect. A square of black posterboard taped to the light momentarily blocks it from your view as the wind or a fan moves it.

A few adaptations for the Maker Faire are using 22 AWG wire, a coin battery, and LED lamps to make portable fireflies without soldering.

### Materials
1. LED - 5mm warm white 3V $0.07
2. battery - 3V CR2032 Lithium Coin Cell $0.24
3. wire - 22 AWG, 5-8' $0.35
4. black electrical tape
5. black posterboard
6. black felt pen
8. wire stripper/cutter
9. scissors (for cutting electrical tape)
10. nail

### Steps
1. Get LED, posterboard square, and battery
2. Make hole in center of black posterboard square using small nail
3. Use marker to blacken hole and edges 
4. Cut 5-8' length of wire, loop in half, tie knots every foot
5. Strip about 1/2" of insulation from all 4 ends
6. Thread one wire through hole in posterboard square and twist onto one LED lead
7. Twist other wire (at same end of bundle) to other LED lead
8. Tape LED connections to posterboard 
9. Tape other ends of wire pair to each side of battery
10. Hang under ceiling fan
