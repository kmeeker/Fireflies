## Fireflies ([Lampyridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly)) ala Imagineering

I've been wanting to create some fireflies for our outdoor train set, and have always loved them in the Pirates of the Carribean ride. A quick Google search turned up this project [Fireflies Project](http://www.hiddenmickeys.org/Imagineering/Fireflies.html)

The cool thing about this design is the simple mechanical method used to create the twinkling effect. A square of black posterboard taped to the light momentarily blocks it from your view as the wind or a fan moves it.

A few adaptations for the Maker Faire are using black thread, a coin battery, and LED lamps to make portable fireflies without soldering.

### Materials
1. LED - 5mm warm white 3V $0.07
2. battery - 3V CR2032 Lithium Coin Cell $0.24
3. black thread
4. black electrical tape
5. black posterboard 
6. black felt pen
7. scissors 
8. hole punch

### Steps
1. Get LED, posterboard square, battery, and ~2" piece of tape
2. Slip LED leads over battery, longer lead on plus side of battery, and tape assembly to middle of black posterboard 
4. Punch hole at one end of posterboard
5. Use marker to blacken hole and edges 
6. Cut 3-4' length of thread and tie one end through hole, and a loop at other end for hanging.
7. Hang where there is a breeze or fan to create flicker effect and motion.
